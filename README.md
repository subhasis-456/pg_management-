# PG Life – Frontend Web Application

PG Life is a responsive web application developed during my Internshala Full Stack Web Development Training. This project was built using my own understanding and frontend development skills, with guidance provided during the training. I customized the user interface based on what I believed would improve the user experience.

This project showcases my frontend development capabilities, and I have integrated my designs with the given PHP structure.
